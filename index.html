        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
       <li> Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. </li>
       <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>

       <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
       <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
       <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. </li>
       <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *</li>
       <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
       <li>Besides text, we can also apply CSS rules to images.</li>
       <li>The block value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
